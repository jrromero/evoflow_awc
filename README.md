## Abstract 
Extracting valuable and novel insights from raw data is a complex process that encompasses various intricate steps. Some of them are repetitive and time-consuming, lending themselves to (partially) automation. AutoML (Automated Machine Learning), a research field focused on methods that (semi-)automate the learning process, includes diverse tasks, such as algorithm selection and hyper-parameter optimisation for a given dataset. However, these methods predominantly concentrate on a single phase, typically model building. In this context, some authors have proposed methods for composing workflows that encompass preprocessing steps, thereby leading to more comprehensive support to the knowledge discovery process. This paper introduces EvoFlow, a grammar-based evolutionary approach for automating workflow composition. By employing a grammar-based approach, our method achieves flexibility, allowing practitioners to adapt EvoFlow to their specific requirements. Furthermore, EvoFlow incorporates two novel characteristics. Firstly, it defines a set of genetic operators explicitly tailored for workflow composition, considering both the optimisation of workflow structure and hyper-parameters. Secondly, it introduces an update mechanism that promotes diversity among individuals and constructs an ensemble of workflows capable of generating diverse predictions, consequently mitigating overfitting. To assess the performance of EvoFlow, we conduct empirical validation using a collection of classification benchmarks. Initially, we compare different variations of EvoFlow to confirm that the proposed enhancements yield improved results. Subsequently, we compare the results obtained with those achieved by other approaches in the literature, including diverse techniques. These comparisons are supported by statistical analyses, revealing that the use of specific genetic operators and the update mechanism significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in terms of predictive performance.
